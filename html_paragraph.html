What is a paragraph? Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers
. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: 
a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc.
<p>

In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph
